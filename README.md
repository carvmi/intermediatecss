# Picasso Painting - FreeCodeCamp

## Technologies 
- HTML
- CSS

## What I have learned
-  "position: absolute" ignores other elements
- Elements with a higher z-index value will appear as if they are overlapping elements with a lower z-index value.
- Properties to modify a border (border-style, border-color, border-width)
- FontAwesome icons come with their own styling to define the icon. However, you can still set the styling yourself as well, to change things like the color and size
